Hi! I am Quang-Cuong Bui (in Vietnamese: Bùi Quang Cường). People often refer to me by the given name **Cường** (/kɯɤŋᴬ²/ {{<inline-audio audio-src="/media/audios/cuong.mp3">}}).

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [Institute of Software Security](https://www.tuhh.de/softsec/), [Hamburg University of Technology](https://www.tuhh.de) under the supervision of [Prof. Riccardo Scandariato](https://scandariato.org). [My Ph.D. research](/pubs) focuses on **automated repair of software vulnerabilities**. Before, I obtained my MSc. degree in Computer Science and my BSc. degree in Information Technology, both at [The VNU University of Engineering and Technology](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/en/). Inspired by my supervisor, I often enjoy spending my spare time with [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/193185180@N02/) using my Sony α6400 (upgraded from α6000).
