Hi! I am Quang-Cuong Bui (in Vietnamese: Bùi Quang Cường). People often refer to me by the given name **Cường** (/kɯɤŋᴬ²/ {{<inline-audio audio-src="/media/audios/cuong.mp3">}}). I was born and brought up in [Anh Sơn—Miền Tây Xứ Nghệ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnRnloNXuHQ) (Central Vietnam).

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Institute of Software Security](https://www.tuhh.de/softsec/) at [TU Hamburg](https://www.tuhh.de) under the supervision of [Prof. Riccardo Scandariato](https://scandariato.org). My research focuses on **automated repair of software vulnerabilities**. Before, I obtained my MSc. degree in Computer Science and my BSc. degree in Information Technology, both at [VNU – UET](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/en/). In my spare time, I spontaneously enjoy writing [blog posts](./blog/) to record my life and share my knowledge.
